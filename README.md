# KitchenRoulette
An app to help you make the best of what's in the kitchen right this second

Users should be able to track ingredients in their kitchens, and get suggestions on how to combine them into something edible.

If a user likes a recipe, they should be able to save it for later.

## Tracking Ingredients

Items the user has in their IRL kitchen can be added to and removed from a virtual "Cupboard".


## Recipe Generation

KitchenRoulette checks the contents of a user's Cupboard and presents a recipe

## Future

### Suggest multiple recipes the user can choose from

Because who doesn't like having options?

### Suggest additional ingredients

If the user's Cupboard is getting bare, KitchenRoulette can suggest the minumum ingredients needed to produce a funcitonal recipe

### Suggestions always on

Allow the user to choose whether additional optional ingredient suggestions should be displayed with Cupboard-based recipes
